# SpaghettiBeams

The end goal of this project is to have a working framework for item tracking purposes. It will use Django as a database to save any pertinent data (specifically items to be tracked) and the GUI will use HTTP calls to that server for any changes made.

Current Goals:
*Get generate_item function working
**Once working, all other functions can be modeled after it
*Create working functions for the following:
**Change whether item is owned or not
**Change whether item is tracked or not
**Create "profiles" with usernames and passwords
***Allows individual tracking
*Add get_picture to each item
**Will be used in GUI
*Once functions are working as intended (except get_picture), create GUI
**Possible GUI languages are Python, Ruby, C++, or C#
